- Up to 6 separate led channels (you can put multiple leds behind one channel)
- Up to 3 separate timers, for full-cycle setups (veg + flo)
- Monitoring a wide range of sensors
- Data sent to a **private** [cloud](https://github.com/supergreenlab/SuperGreenCloud)
- Produce alerts based on sensor values
- Allows remote control (TODO)
- Manual ventilation control
- Automatic ventilation control based on temperature and humidity (TODO)
- `Stretch` mode, allows to choose how much you want your plant to stretch or thicken
