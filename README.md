# SuperGreenOS

![WeedAppPic](assets/weedapppic.png?raw=true "WeedAppPic")

SuperGreenOS provides most features used when growing cannabis, all in one package, and controllable from your smartphone, pc, mac, linux, toaster, plumbus, whatnot...

Here's what it can (or will) do:

- Lights on and off schedules
- Up to 6 separate led drivers controls (you can put multiple leds behind one driver)
- Up to 3 separate timers, for full-cycle setups (veg + flo)
- Monitoring a wide range of sensors
- Data sent to a **private** [cloud](https://github.com/supergreenlab/SuperGreenCloud)
- Produce alerts based on sensor values (ok right now not that much, but hey I'm doing my best:P)
- Allows remote control (TODO)
- Manual ventilation control
- Automatic ventilation control based on temperature and humidity (TODO)
- `Stretch` mode, allows to choose how much you want your plant to stretch or thicken
- `Sunglass` mode, so you don't burn your eyes when you work on your plants
- More to come..

This is the firmware that runs the [SuperGreenDriver](https://github.com/supergreenlab/SuperGreenDriver).

# Development

This code is based on [SuperGreenOSBoilerplate](https://github.com/supergreenlab/SuperGreenOSBoilerplate), please refer to this repo for technical details.
